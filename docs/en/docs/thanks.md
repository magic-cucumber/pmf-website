# Special Thanks

As of October 2025, PMF has exceeded 13k cumulative downloads across release channels.

This achievement would not have been possible without the support of contributors. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all contributors and users.

At the same time, we extend our heartfelt thanks to the Kotlin language development team, AndroidX maintainers, and all developers of the open-source libraries used by PMF.

Due to space limitations, the complete list of open-source libraries has been included in the application's **About** page.
