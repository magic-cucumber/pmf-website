## Preparation Before Submission

- Please make sure you are using the latest version of Pixiv-MultiPlatform, as the features you want may have already been implemented in the latest version.
- Before asking questions, please make sure you have read [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)
- Please ensure that you can respond to the author's reply in a timely manner. I will close and archive issues that have no response for a long time.
- I will handle issues on Github. If you don't have a Github account, please register first.
